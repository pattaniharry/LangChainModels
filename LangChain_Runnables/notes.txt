What are Runnables ?

Consider them as a unit of work every runnable in langchain has a purpose

you can give input the runnable processes it and give you output 

every runnable follow a common interface 
    1. very popular method is invoke()
    2. Batch - using this a runnable could process multiple 
    input and give multiple outputs 
    3. Stream() for streaming output 


as this runnable are made from common interface so you could connect
this runnable easily and execute any complex workflow 


Basically a standardized abstract class which has the same invoke function 
for smooth integration is called Runables 

How many Types of Runnables in LangChain 

1. Task Specific Runnables 
2. Runnable Primitives 

 
 TASK SPECIFIC RUNNABLES 

 Definition : These are core LangChain components that have been 
 converted into Runnables so they can be used in pipelines
 
 e.g - Prompt Templates , Retriver 

 RUNNABLE PRIMITIVES 

 Definition : these are fundamental building blocks for structuring
 execution logic in AI workflows 

e.g - Runnable Sequence , Runnable Parallel 

1. Runable Sequence 
It is a sequential chain of runnable in LangChain that executes each step
one after another , Passing the output of one step as the input
of the next 

2. Runnable Parallel
Helps in building parallel chains 

3. RunnablePassthrough 

Runnable RunnablePassthrough is a special Runnable primitive that 
simply returns the input as output without modifying it 

4. Runnable Lambda 
it is a runnable primitive that allows you to apply custom python 
functions withtin an AI pipline 
acting as a middle ware betwen AI components 

5. RunnableBranch 

it is a control flow component in LangChain that allows you to conditionally 
route input data to different chains or runnables based on custom 
logic 

6. LCEL
langchain expression language 
e.g ("|") symbol for chains
