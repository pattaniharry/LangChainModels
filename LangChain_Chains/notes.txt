LangChain chains helps us create pipelines for the data to flow from template to template to user 


without chain all the commands to the parser to each template will be done manually 


In Chains you would just have to give input to pipelines as you give that the pipeline will automatically trigger and do the rest and give output 

We can even create conditional chains using chain feature of LangChain



Sequential Chain 

Topic -> LLM -> detailed report -> LLM -> summary  

Parallel Chain 

from a give input by user lets say we want to build some notes and quiz so that will 
work parallel
