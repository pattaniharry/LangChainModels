LangChain chains helps us create pipelines for the data to flow from template to template to user 


without chain all the commands to the parser to each template will be done manually 


In Chains you would just have to give input to pipelines as you give that the pipeline will automatically trigger and do the rest and give output 

We can even create conditional chains using chain feature of LangChain
