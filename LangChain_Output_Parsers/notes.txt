String Output Parser

a string output parser mostly used in chaining helps when we have a pipeline set and where we don't need additional information to go on to the next prompt template and only 
require the content that is outputed from the predecessor prompt 

without string output parser result is possible but we had to extract content from each prompt template each time  parser will do the hard work while chaining 



JSON OUTPUT PARSER  

It forces llm to give output in json format 
when using json output parser you will get an json formatted output but you cannot decide the schema of the output , that will be decided by the parser itself 

for structureing of output parser we use JSON SCHEMA OUTPUT PARSER or PYDANTIC OUTPUT PARSER  


PYDANTIC OUTPUT PARSER 
Strict schema enforcement 
Type safety 
Easy Validation 
Seamless integration
