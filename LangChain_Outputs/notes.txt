Getting Output from LLM's 

you give input there is processing in input and then there is output that is in text format 

so that output text is in unstructured format you can do the following things to make it structured 

WHY DO WE NEED STRUCTURED OUTPUT ??

1.Makes llm response machine readable 
2. eliminate fragile text parsing 
3. Reduces hallucination related bug 
4. Enables automation 



with_structured_output is a function that is used to bring out sturucted output from llms that can produce structured output (some llms' can't produce structured otuput )

you have to define with_structued_output(your output requirement format ) before doing model.invoke 


3 ways to do dataformat 

1. type dictionaries


2. pydantic

pydantic have type safety unlike typedict which defines but does not validate 
pydantic also validates and gives error incase of type differnece 

there are field functions that helps create constraints , regex ,default values , and descriptions 

cna be converted to dict or json 

3. json schema 

what to use when ?

use type dict when you can use python on the whole project 
and schema is not being shared with anyother language 

use pydantic if you need data validation need default values and want automatic type conversion 

use json schema  if you don't want to export any other extra python libraries 
need validation but don't need pyhton objects 
want to define a structure in a standard JSON format 


APPLICATIONS 
its used in data extraction

///OUTPUT PARSERS

StrOutParser 
simplest parser in langchain parsers the output of the LLM  in the form of a string
