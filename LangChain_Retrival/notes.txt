A retriever is a componenet in LangChain that fetches relevant
documents from a data source in resoponse to user's query 

There are multiple types of retrievers 

1. Based on Data source 
2. Based on Search strategy     

All retrivers in LangChain are RUNNABLES

VECTOR STORE RETRIEVER

A vector store retriver in LangChain is the most common type of retriever 
that lets you Search and fetch documents from a vector store
nased on semantic - similarity using vector embeddings 


ADVANCED TYPE OF RETRIVAL 

1. MMR  - MAXIMUM MARGINAL RELAVANCE 

MMR is an information retrival algorithm designed to reduce redundancy in the retreved 
results while maintaining high relevance to the query 


2. Multi - Query Retriever

Multi-Query Retrieval means:

 Take one user question, generate multiple reworded versions using an LLM, 
 search the vector database with each version, and combine the results.


3. Contextual Compression Retriever

the Contextual Compression retriver in langchain is an ADVANCED retriever
that improves retrival quality by compressing documents after retrival
keeping only relavant contnet based on the user's query
