Text splitting is the process of breaking large chunks of Text
into smaller manageable pieces that an LLM can handle effectively

What is the use of Text Splitter

any given LLM has a context length so the whole context is blurred
or lost when the token size of context length exceeds 

text splitting is also useful and neccessary in Semantic Search, Summarization
, embedding 



Types of text splitter 

Length Based 
Text Structure Based 
Document Structure Based 


Semantic Meaning Based 

- take text and converts it into vectors using embedding models 
- finds consine similiarity to find similiarities 
- seperate them using standard deviation 
- find similar numbers and thus have same context
